            JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to make web pages interactive and dynamic.
             It was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995 and has since become one of the core technologies of the web, alongside HTML and CSS. 
             Originally designed to run in browsers, JavaScript can now also run on servers using environments like Node.js. 
             It follows the ECMAScript specification and supports various programming paradigms including object-oriented, imperative, and functional styles.
             Variables in JavaScript can be declared using var, let, or const, and it is known for being dynamically and loosely typed.
             Functions are treated as first-class objects, meaning they can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. 
             One of JavaScriptâ€™s main roles in web development is manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model), allowing developers to change content and structure on the fly.
